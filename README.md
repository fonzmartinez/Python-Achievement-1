## Exercise 1.2 - Data Types in Python

Task Requirements:
  - Create a structure that contains a set of attributes related to a specific recipe, and several of these “recipe structures” need to be stored sequentially in another outer structure.

PLEASE NOTE: The data structure being used for this particular task of a recipe 
             will be Dictionaries.  A dictionary would work best as different 
             value types would be used in a recipe (ex/ strings, integers, 
             lists). Since a dictionary stores values and objects within itself 
             indexed by keys, it is easier to locate item and update as needed.  
             With the use of key-value pairing, a dictionary is versatile and 
             would be best for building a recipe.


Task Directions:
  - Create a structure named 'recipe_1' that contains the following keys:
        1. name (str): Contains the name of the recipe 
        2. cooking_time (int): Contains the cooking time in minutes       
        3. ingredients (list): Contains a number of ingredients, each of the str data type
        
Decide what data structure you would use for this purpose, and in your README file in the repository for this task, describe in approx. 50-75 words why you’ve chosen to use it.

  - The 'recipe_1' structure that you create will be for a cup of tea, with the following attributes:
        1. Name: Tea
        2. Cooking time: 5 minutes
        3. Ingredients: Tea leaves, Sugar, Water

  - Create an outer structure called all_recipes, and then add recipe_1 to it. Figure out what type of structure you would consider for all_recipes, and briefly note down your justification in the README file. Ideally, this outer structure should be sequential in nature, where multiple recipes can be stored and modified as required.

  - Generate 4 more recipes as 'recipe_2, recipe_3, recipe_4, and recipe_5', and then add them as well to all_recipes.

  - Once you’re done setting up all_recipes, print the ingredients of each recipe as five different lists, inside the IPython shell.
